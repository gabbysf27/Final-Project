                <h2>Navigating the COVID-19 pandemic as a university student</h2>
                <p>In early March hundreds of universities switched to online learning as COVID-19 hit the United States and forced everyone into quarantine. At first many students and faculty at the University of California Berkeley believed they would all return after spring break at the end of the month. Dreadfully, that thought couldn’t be farther from the truth. </p>  

                <p>“I remember watching Marilyn [my roommate] cry and I didn’t understand why she was freaking out so much because I didn’t think this was going to be as big of a thing as it was,” 23-year-old Berkeley student, Justin Hong said. “Then, that’s when it hit the rest of us.” </p>

                <p>Hong expressed that the transition to remote learning was anything but easy. It was stressful and hard to keep up with schoolwork. But luckily he had two roommates who he grew close to during this rough period.</p>
                <p>“I really clung to my housemates, my friends. We were all in the same boat. We all freaked out. We all tried to figure out Zoom and classes together,” Hong said.</p>
                <p>Jessica Perez, a fourth-year and now recent graduate from UC Berkeley felt similarly to Hong.</p>
                <p>“It was so much harder to attend class on zoom,” Perez said. “I had a few teachers that implemented strict policies on having our cameras on during class and it’s difficult to do that when you’re living in a house full of people. I really began to dread class online.”</p> 
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic ripped through 2020 and threw everyone’s plans and sense of normalcy out the window. Especially for university students, the pandemic has taken a huge toll on mental health, physical activity and professional or personal plans.</p> 
                <p>Due to the pandemic, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/06/23/report-covid-19-has-hurt-college-students">13 percent</a> of students have delayed their graduation date and about 40 percent have lost a job, internship offer or job offer, according to a research study conducted by Arizona State University.

                <p>As an incoming fourth-year student, Hong still has one more year at UC Berkeley. While a number of his extracurricular events were canceled last semester he’s thankful he still has one more year as a student.</p> 
                <p>“No one knows for sure, but I think spring [semester] will probably not be in-person,” Hong said. “Even though it could still be online and I might not have the graduation I’m hoping for, I think it will still be nice to at least graduate in a period where I know what’s going on.”</p> 
                <p>When asked about his new role this coming school year as a Resident Manager, Hong expressed that he is worried about how many students will plan to move into the house he manages. As of now he only has five residents living with him. Hong has been going back and forth with the housing company he works for communicating his household’s concerns on having over 20 people potentially moving in for the fall semester.</p> 
                <p>Perez is planning to begin graduate school this fall at Columbia University pursuing a Ph.D. in Music. When asked about how she felt having her first semester online she admitted she was quite remorseful but has quickly adapted her plans. </p>
                <p>“In June the professors didn’t even know the decision for the fall yet,” Perez said. “They were too busy still figuring out the summer semester, and I was worried about signing up for student housing since you have to put down a deposit.”</p> 
                <p>Perez is planning to live with her partner, Zane Martin, in North Carolina as he attends Duke University online.</p> 
                <p>“I’m excited because we’ll have a lot of space in our apartment and the rent is cheaper than in New York. But, I’m definitely excited to move to New York once everything starts to open up again,” Perez expressed.</p> 
                <p>Whether it’s graduating, beginning grad school or finishing up the last year of undergraduate work most university students are feeling quite uneasy during the pandemic. Staying home to attend class is the new normal and banding together with housemates, family and friends are what is proving to keep most of us sane.</p>
